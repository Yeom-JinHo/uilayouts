            A UI (User Interface) component is a modular, reusable element that
            serves a specific function within a graphical user interface.
            Examples include buttons, input fields, dropdown menus, sliders, and
            checkboxes.

            UI components promote consistency, efficiency, and scalability in
            software development. They allow developers to reuse code, maintain
            a consistent look and feel across an application, and easily make
            updates or modifications without affecting the entire system.

        <AccordionItem value='item-3'>
          <AccordionHeader customIcon>

          <AccordionPanel>
            Well-designed UI components should be modular, customizable, and
            accessible. They should have clear and intuitive functionality, be
            easily styled to match the overall design language of the
            application.
